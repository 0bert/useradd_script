AUTOMATING THE useradd COMMAND:
Command automation is refers to the process of automationg repetitive or routine tasks using commands or scripts.
The aim of command automation is to to reduce human intervention and increase efficiency and accuracy by
automationg these tasks. In the context of software development, command automation can be used to automate various
tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code. This helps to streamline the developmentprocess, reduce the chances of
errors, and making it faster and easier to deliver high-quality software. I am a DevOps engineer though.

MY PURPOSE OF CREATING THIS SCRIPT:
If you have noticed, or whenever you will notice, it will be the Linux system engineer or Administrator who constantly creates 
user accounts for every Linux user in a company. Sometimes he/she forgets due to other important responsibilities to tace care 
of. I am not saying creating accounts is not important, but this type of task can easily be handled by the newly hired employee or whosover in the company who needs a linux profile, so that the Linux engineer or system administrator takes care of other 
but more pressing production tasks.

I hvae automated the useradd command with a simple and intutive script for everyone to use. This script is the product of a
1 hour script class in my DevOps training using just the echo & read commands. My script is still being developed, will be
revised as I gain more knowledge in scripting. However, it still does the job. But my goal is to create a script that can do
everything any Linux machine can do, intuitively to make user experience more efficient and enjoyable.

Thank You!
